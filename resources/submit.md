# How to Run and Submit

# Running Assignments

The computing platform we will be using this semester is a [shared JupyterHub instance](https://comsc341cd-hub-sp.mtholyoke.edu) running on campus. You will be able to access this server from anywhere on campus using your MHC credentials. If you are off-campus, you'll need to connect to the MHC VPN -- instructions on how to do so are [linked here](https://asklits.mtholyoke.edu/TDClient/50/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=281). If you have any trouble connecting to the server or run into issues while on the server, please reach out to me!

Every assignment will be posted on this website as a templated Jupyter notebook. To open the notebook on the server, click on the "launch" rocket ship icon in the top right corner of the page and select "JupyterHub".

Make sure to save your work often, in case you get disconnected from the server.

# Submitting to Gradescope

Once you are ready to submit your assignment, you'll need to submit the following files to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/950344):

- Your completed `.ipynb` notebook file, which you can download by going to `File -> Download`.
- A `.py` file of your notebook's code, which you can download by going to `File -> Save and Export Notebook As -> Executable Script`.

:::{tip}
To make sure you've answered all questions, perform a search for `TODO` in your notebook!
