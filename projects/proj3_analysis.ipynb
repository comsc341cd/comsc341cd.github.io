    "\n",
    "[McDonald et al. (1992)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1522792/) was an early \"nudge\" study that used computerized reminders sent to physicians to encourage them to give flu vaccines to their patients. It has since been frequently used to study the relationship between intent-to-treat (ITT) and complier-based effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prior Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a motivation and description of the study design adapted and sourced from [Hirano et al. (2000)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12933526/):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because of epidemiologic evidence of increased morbidity related to influenza, experimental evidence of serologic efficacy (ie, antibody production) of the influenza vaccine, and observational studies suggesting improved outcomes in vaccinated patients, health officials in most countries recommend annual influenza vaccination for elderly persons and other people at high risk of influenza. However, no randomized controlled trials of the effects of the influenza vaccination on pulmonary (ie, lung and respiratory-related) morbidity in high-risk adults have been published (McDonald et al., 1992). One reason for this is that demonstrated efficacy for some subpopulations raises ethical barriers against performing randomized controlled trials on other subpopulations, which would require withholding vaccination from some subjects. One way around this impasse is to perform a randomized trial of an intervention that increases the use of influenza vaccine in one group of patients without affecting the use of influenza vaccine in another group. McDonald et al. (1992) exploited this idea to study influenza vaccine efficacy in reducing morbidity in high-risk adults, using a computer-generated reminder for flu shots. The study was conducted over a 3-year period (1978â€“1980) in an academic primary-care practice affiliated with a large urban public teaching hospital. Physicians in the practice were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a control group at the beginning of the study. Since physicians at the clinic each cared for a fixed group of patients, their patients were similarly classified. During the study period, physicians in the intervention group received a computer-generated reminder when a patient with a scheduled appointment was eligible for the influenza vaccine under U.S. Public Health Service Criteria.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We analyse this study using 2861 individuals observed in 1980, a particularly severe flu epidemic season. For each person $i$ we observe: a binary variable $Z_i$ , the â€˜assignmentâ€™ or â€˜encouragementâ€™, equal to one if patient $i$â€™s physician received a reminder letter indicating that the patient was eligible to receive the influenza vaccine under U.S. Public Health Service Criteria and zero otherwise; a binary variable $T_i$ , the â€˜treatmentâ€™, equal to 1 if person $i$ received the vaccine and 0 otherwise; a binary outcome $Y_i$ , equal to 1 if person $i$ subsequently experienced a flu-related hospitalization during the winter, which we define as being hospitalized for respiratory problems, and 0 otherwise."

    "> **Do We Care About the Local Average Treatment Effect?**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The local average treatment effect is an unusual [causal quantity]. It is an average effect of the treatment for a subpopulation that cannot be identified in the sense that there are no units whom we know for sure to belong to this subpopulation, although there are some units whom we know do not belong to it. A more conventional approach is to start an analysis by clearly articulating the object of interest, say the average effect of a treatment for a well-defined population. There may be challenges in obtaining credible estimates of this object of interest, and along the way one may make more or less credible assumptions, but typically the focus remains squarely on the originally specified object of interest.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Here, the approach appears to be quite different. We did not articulate explicitly what the target [causal quantity] was. In the McDonald et al. influenza-vaccine application a natural quantity might be the [average treatment effect] of the vaccine. Then, apparently more or less by accident, the definition of the compliance types led us to focus on the average effects for compliers. In this example, the compliers were defined by the response in terms of the receipt of the vaccine to the receipt of the letter. It appears difficult to argue that this is a substantially interesting group, and in fact no attempt was made to do so.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This type of example has led distinguished researchers both in economics and in statistics to question whether and why one should care about the local average treatment effect. The economist Angus Deaton writes \"I find it hard to make any sense of the LATE [local average treatment effect]\". Judea Pearl similarly wonders \"Realizing that the population averaged treatment effect (ATE) is not identifiable in experiments marred by noncompliance, they have shifted attention to a specific response type (i.e., compliers) for which the causal effect was identifiable, and presented the latter [the local average treatment] as an approximation for ATE. However, most authors in this category do not state explicitly whether their focus on a specific stratum (the compliers) is motivated by mathematical convenience, mathematical necessity (to achieve identification) or a genuine interest in the [group] under analysis\"...Let me attempt to clear up this confusion. An instrumental variables analysis is an analysis in a second-best setting. It would have been preferable if one had been able to carry out a well-designed randomized experiment. However, such an experiment was not carried out, and we have noncompliance. As a result, we cannot answer all the questions we might have wanted to ask. Specifically, if the noncompliance is substantial, we are limited in the questions we can answer credibly and precisely. Ultimately, there is only one subpopulation we can credibly (point-)identify the average effect of the treatment for, namely, the compliers.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> It may be useful to draw an analogy. Suppose a researcher is interested in evaluating a medical treatment and suppose a randomized experiment had been carried out to estimate the average effect of this new treatment. However, the population of the randomized experiment included only [college students], and the researcher is interested in the average effect for the entire population...What should the researcher do? I would argue that the researcher should report the results for the [college students], and acknowledge the limitation of the results for the original question of interest. Similarly, in the instrumental variables I see the limitation of the results to the compliers as one that was unintended, but driven by the lack of identification for other subpopulations given the design of the study. This limitation should be acknowledged, but one should not drop the analysis simply because the original [causal quantity] cannot be identified. Note that our case with instrumental variables is slightly worse than in the given example, because we cannot actually identify all individuals with certainty as compliers."
