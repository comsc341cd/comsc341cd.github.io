# Final Project Checkpoint


Please submit an in-progress [final project ipynb](https://comsc341cd.github.io/projects/final_template.html). It should contain the following, though you are more than welcome to submit more:

- **[1 pt]** evidence of processed/cleaned data loaded into your notebook via a `dataframe.head()` call.

- **[1 pt]** ~1-2 paragraph summaries for each of the papers selected from your literature review. 
    - **Note**: these paragraphs do not need to be integrated in your "prior knowledge" discussion yet -- you can just have them as standalone summaries.

- **[1 pt]** An outline of your study's design step, including the relevant assumptions you need to make. Include any questions you have in the outline you'd like feedback on.

- **[1 pt]** A draft DAG of your study. If there are many confounders, you can represent them as a single node and list them separately. 
    - **Note**: make sure that your DAG image file is uploaded on Gradescope.

- **[1 pt]** An outline of your analysis plan for the estimation step, including what estimators you will use and how you will implement them (e.g. using the functions we have implemented in the course, or by using a different package). Include any questions you have in the outline you'd like feedback on.

Like the proposal, the checkpoint will be graded on best-effort completion. I will be reviewing the checkpoints, so the more you are able to submit, the more specific feedback I can provide to guide your final report submission.
