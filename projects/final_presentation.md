# Final Project Teaching Presentation

## Logistics

- 6 minutes per group
- Format will be Google Slides to make transitions between groups easier
- Sign up for a presentation slot [linked here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sl4H-FZpdZxEXRPovYajXtZY7UwCduaavG1TpA-oiHc/edit?usp=sharing):
    - 9 slots for 5/01 (Thu)
    - 5 slots for 5/06 (Tue)


## Guidelines

- You should cover the causal roadmap up through the design step.
    - Thus your presentation does *not* have to include any analysis, estimation, or interpretation of results.
- **Prior knowledge**: provide a motivation and background for the problem.
    - Think of yourself as a policymaker or scientist pitching the significance of your domain to the general public -- why do we care about the causal question, and how can your study help us understand it?
- **Question**: state your specific causal question and the associated causal quantity.
- **Design**:
    - Introduce your dataset and how it is connected to the causal question.
    - Describe your study strategy and the relevant treatment, outcome, and covariate variables via your DAG.
    - Explain the assumptions needed for your study design and how you are handling them in your project.
- **Wrap-up**: Conclude with a brief forward-looking statement about what you hope to learn from your analysis and how it might inform future work in this domain.


## Peer feedback

During the presentations, you will give feedback to your classmates according to the following template:

Please provide one constructive point (though feel free to add more) for the two sections below. Your feedback will help the presenting group improve their final submission.

### What I enjoyed

Things you can consider:
- Clear motivation
- Interesting dataset
- Creative study strategy for answering the causal question
- Clarity in assumption assessment or DAG design

### Thoughts on study design and assumptions

Things you can consider:
- Are their treatment and control groups appropriately defined?
- How did they connect the measured outcome in the dataset to the causal question they are interested in?
- How was their assessment of assumptions handled for their study design?
- Are there any additional confounders/covariates that they could consider?
