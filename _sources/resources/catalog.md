### Consistency

*   
    - **Definition**
    - The observed outcome $Y$ for a unit is the same as the potential outcome $Y(T=t)$ for that unit under the treatment that was actually observed $T=t$.

*
    - **Mathematical definition**
    - $Y = Y(T)$<br><br>For binary treatment, that means: <ul><li>$Y = Y(1) \text{ if } T=1$</li><li>$Y = Y(0) \text{ if } T=0$</li></ul>

*   
    - **Definition**
    - The distribution of $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$ for the $T=1$ and $T=0$ groups are the same. Also known as **ignorability**.

*
    - **Mathematical definition**
    - $Y(0), Y(1) \perp T$

    - **Intuition/Examples**

### Conditional Exchangeability

*
    - **Definition**
    - The distribution of $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$ for the $T=1$ and $T=0$ groups are the same, conditional on some variables $X$. Also known as **unconfoundedness**. We determine which variables $X$ to condition on based on the **backdoor criterion**.


*
    - **Mathematical definition**
    - $Y(0), Y(1) \perp T \mid X$

*
    - **Intuition/Examples**
    - [Activity 8](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wXOXM30_ipZlbI8F_yrRnp9_6xR7tdyn3RX0a67UNBk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.x6szsl4jkr1q) on how to determine which variables satisfy the backdoor criterion

(positivity)=
### Positivity

    -
    -

*
    - **Definition**
    - Every unit has a non-zero probability of receiving the treatment, and every unit has a non-zero probability of not receiving the treatment. We can also view it as: every subgroup $x$ in our sample has to have some units that received the treatment, and some units that did not receive the treatment. Also known as **overlap**.


*
    - **Mathematical definition**
    - For all values of covariates $x \in X$: 
    $$
    0 < P(T = 1 \mid X = x) < 1
    $$

*
    - **Intuition/Examples**
    - See [Lecture 8, beginning at slide 25](https://moodle.mtholyoke.edu/pluginfile.php/1496644/mod_resource/content/2/lec08-observational-studies-ii.pdf) for intuition and PollEverywhere example, as well as [Activity 9](https://comsc341cd.github.io/activities/activity9_solution.html#activity9-solution) for seeing bins of covariates in Yeager et al.
